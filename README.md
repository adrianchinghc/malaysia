Hi, welcome to Malaysia! The land of nasi lemak & durian :D

This handbook is inspired by our neighbour's [handbook](https://github.com/rubysg/singapore), and it's something that the Kuala Lumpur's Ruby community, the [KL Ruby Brigade](http://rubybrigade.my), put together as a guide to anyone who's visiting Malaysia. 

This handbook will be for Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia, for the time being.
